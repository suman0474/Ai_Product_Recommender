=== PROMPT: GENERIC_SPECIFICATIONS ===
List 15 latest advanced specifications for {product_type} (past 6 months).
Focus on: IoT, Industry 4.0, AI, protocols, cybersecurity, cloud, series numbers, model specifications.
Include specific series numbers and generation information.
Return JSON array in snake_case: ["series_5000_hart_protocol", "gen3_wireless_diagnostics", "model_pro_cybersecurity"]

=== PROMPT: PARAMETER_DISCOVERY ===
You are an expert in industrial instrumentation and vendor product catalogs.

Task:
- Provide up to 5 human-friendly names of the latest advanced parameters or features for {product_type} from the past 6 months.
- Include series numbers and model/generation hints inside the human-readable name where applicable (for example: "Series 5000 HART Diagnostics").
- DO NOT return keys or code-friendly names — return only an array of human-readable strings.

Product type: {product_type}
Existing schema parameter keys (snake_case): {existing_parameters}

**CRITICAL - Avoid Duplicates:**
Do NOT suggest parameters that are semantically similar to existing ones.

Examples of what to AVOID:
- If "output_signal" exists, DON'T suggest "signal_output", "output_type", or "signal_type"
- If "pressure_range" exists, DON'T suggest "range_pressure", "pressure_limits", or "measurement_range"
- If "communication_protocol" exists, DON'T suggest "protocol_communication" or "comm_protocol"
- If "temperature_range" exists, DON'T suggest "temp_range" or "operating_temperature"

Examples of what IS acceptable (truly new parameters):
- If "output_signal" exists, you CAN suggest "wireless_diagnostics" (different concept)
- If "pressure_range" exists, you CAN suggest "predictive_maintenance" (different concept)

Return strict JSON only in this exact format and nothing else:
{{
  "parameters": [
    "Human Readable Parameter Name 1",
    "Another Parameter Name (Series X)",
  ]
}}

Rules:
- Do NOT include any parameter whose snake_case key (derived from the human name) would match an existing schema key.
- Prefer no more than 5 parameters.
- Do NOT include any extra commentary or markdown.
